# Programming Challenge Project with Ionic and Vue.js

This is a programming challenge project where I created an application using Ionic and Vue.js to list movies from an API and allow access to the details of each movie. Below are the steps to initialize and run the project.

## Project Initialization

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
1. Open your terminal or command line.
2. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the project.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
1. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
### Step 3: Run the Application in Development Mode
1. Run the following command to start the application in development mode:

   ```bash
   ionic serve
   ```

2. This will automatically open the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't, open a browser and navigate to the address: `http://localhost:8100`.

### Step 4: Explore the Application
1. In the application, in the registration tab, you will see a form with some Ionic components.
2. In the movies tab, you should see a list of movies on the main page extracted from a movies API.
3. Click on a movie to access its details, where you can view more detailed information about the movie.
